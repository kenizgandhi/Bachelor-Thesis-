Measure weight of moving trucks using RL78 MCU

Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) technologies allow trucks to be weighed in the traffic flow, without any disruption to operations.
Weigh-in-Motion systems can be readily built with a low cost and easily available equipments.
These equipment are easy to set-up with higher efficiency. Weigh-in-motion data can be collected
with its WIM equipment and in LabVIEW via Serial Communication, where the vehicle reports
its own weight. Weigh-in-motion devices are designed to capture and record axle weights and
gross vehicle weights as vehicles drive over a measurement site.
